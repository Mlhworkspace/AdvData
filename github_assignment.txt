I downloaded the FBI NICS Firearm Background Check Data from BuzzFeedNews. The code rips the data from an FBI PDF that then gets parsed and turned into a spreadsheet. When looking at the code, I can tell that there is code included that I think updates every X ticks to see if any data was added or changed. I think it's cool how BuzzFeed News identified that the information wasn't presented in an ideal form, so they worked around it to create the more useful form. 

I'd like to know if the program runs automatically like I thought or is manually done once a month or so.
